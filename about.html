        <p class="lead">My name is Darren Wong Sr. and I am the founder and owner of Pro Landscape Maintenance. I started this company in 1992 in my beautiful hometown of Kailua, O'ahu. For over twenty years Pro Landscape has been providing excellent landscape design, lawn and yard service, and maintenance to residential and commercial clients across the islands. The most gratifying part of this job is helping to realize a client's dream to its full potential through beautiful design and function. I specialize in design and installation of all lawn components, sprinkle irrigation, water features, tile and stone work, and all florist/nursery needs. No job is too big or small.</p>

        <p class="lead">I was born and raised in Hawai'i and am incredibly lucky that my work allows me to help keep this island beautiful. I live in Kailua and have three amazing kids.</p>

        <p class="lead">If given the opportunity to work together, I will work with you diligently to fulfill your lawn ans garden needs. Let's turn your landscaping ideas into reality!</p>
